### Built-in

- `/expansion [action=list]`
  
  Shows/reload expansion commands. Without parameter or with parameter `list` will show loaded expansion status.

  With parameter `reload`, this will compare hash of expansion script and datafile to determine modified files.
  Then it tries to import it dynamically.
  
  You can add new commands or edit existing ones on-the-fly with this reload feature, as long as if it follows certain rules.
  
  Here's example what module should contain.
  
  ```python
  from discord.ext.commands import Context
  
  from . import CommandRepresentation
  
  
  async def some_command(context: Context):
      ...
  
  
  async def another_command(context: Context, some_args: str):
      ...
  
  
  __all__ = [
      CommandRepresentation(some_command, name="your_own_command", help="help_message"),
      CommandRepresentation(another_command, name="your_own_command", help="help_message")
  ]
  ```
  Any script containing `__all__` list with [`CommandRepresentaion`](BotComponents/__init__.py) class will be loaded dynamically upon reload call.

All other commands are not built-in. Documentation on those are currently WIP.
